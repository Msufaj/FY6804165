<p class="ex1">
<pre>This article explores the intracacies of electrical systems in aircraft, highlighting their critical role in modern aviation. 
    All but the most basic aircraft designs require an electrical system as a crucial part to ensure safety, navigation and overall operational efficiency. 
    An aircraft powered by a single piston engine for general aviation and a modern multi-engine commercial jet have quite different electrical systems in terms of capacity and complexity. The rapid 
    advancement of these sytems shows the paramount importance of aviation to humans as we connect cultures, grow economies and tackle environmental problems.

<p class="ex1">
<pre>Nowadays, electrical componentsÂ are more frequently used in aircraft design instead of mechanical ones. Benefits of these modern designs are plentiful. However, any system must first be shown to 
  be safe, dependable, and able to be maintained over the aircraft's lifespan before it can be put into service, just like any other design concept. An electrical system's primary duties are to 
  generate, control, and distribute electricity throughout the aircraft. There is a direct correlation between the dependability of electrical systems and subsystems and aircraft performance. 
  Electrical systems in aeroplanes often use both AC and DC power.
