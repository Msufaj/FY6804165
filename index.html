  This article explores the intracacies of electrical systems in aircraft, highlighting their critical role in modern aviation. All but the most basic aircraft designs require an electrical system as
  a crucial mechanism to ensure safety, navigation and overall operational efficiency. An aircraft powered by a single piston engine for general aviation and a modern multi-engine commercial jet have 
  quite different electrical systems in terms of capacity and complexity. The rapid advancement of these sytems shows the paramount importance of aviation to humans as we connect cultures, grow 
  economies and tackle environmental problems.

  The aviation industry has seen a dramatic shift from mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic system. Nowadays, electrical components are more frequently used in aircraft design instead of mechanical 
  ones. Benefits of these modern designs are plentiful. However, any system must first be shown to be safe, dependable, and able to be maintained over the aircraft's lifespan before it can be put into
  service, just like any other design concept. An electrical system's primary duties are to generate, control, and distribute electricity throughout the aircraft. There is a direct correlation between
  the dependability of electrical systems and subsystems and aircraft performance. Electrical systems in aeroplanes often use both AC and DC power. This is designed to provide a continuous supply of 
  electricity to power the various electrical components and charge the battery once the engine has started.

   Some very simple engine aircraft do not have an electrical system installed. The piston engine is equipped with a Magneto ignition sytem, which is self-powering and the fuel tank is situated so it
   will gravity feed the engine. However, there is always a need for small electrically powered devices within the aircraft itself, "But if you add a starter, lights, radio, or fuel pumps needed for 
   low-wing aircraft designs, then you’ll require an electrical system to power them. Usually a battery and an engine-driven generator or alternator combine to perform this task. The battery provides 
   power to start the engine, which then turns the alternator or generator, so that it produces power for the aircraft’s electrical needs (and to recharge the battery). An electrical bus think of it 
   as a circuit distributes the power" (Collins.M, 2020). The system will typically be powered by direct current, relying on a solitary distribution bus, one battery and a single engine-driven 
   generator or alternator. Features such as an on/off switch will be integrated to enable disconnecting the battery from the bus and separating the alternator from it. There would also be instruments 
   like ammeters, load meters or warning lights set up in order to detect any malfunctions within the charging systems. Electrical components are interconnected to the busbar with circuit breakers or 
   fuses installed for protective measures against electrical overloads. 

   More sophisticated electrical systems are usually multiple voltage systems using a combination of AC and DC buses to power various aircraft components. "Primary power generation is normally AC with 
   one or more Transformer Rectifier Unit (TRU) providing conversion to DC voltage to power the DC busses. Secondary AC generation from an APU is usually provided for use on the ground when engines 
   are not running and for airborne use in the event of component failure" (skybrary, 2023). These systems usually consist of electrical generators, power electronics, energy storage devices and 
   actuators. The more advanced components can power environmental subsystems , anti-icing devices, communications (internal and external) and a myriad of other key functional parts of the aircraft.
   New designs were a must for these components, as they were required to be lighter and as small as possible to be most efficient as used by the more electric aircraft (MEA). As seen with cars,
   hybrid electric propulsion systems are being considered for future larger commercial aircraft, "Such improvements can offset the relatively reduced range hybrid electric aircraft currently have. 
   While the possibility of an all-electric passenger aircraft is far into the future, hybrid electric aircraft can achieve the best of both worlds" (Dr MEMON.O,December 9th 2022,). These combine gas 
   turbines with electrical power generatiion and storage systems. Each of the electric propulsion systems rely entirely on electrical power, either generated in a fuel cell or from storage in a 
   capacitor or battery. A parallel hybrid approach utilizes a source of stored electrical energy to power an electric motor and deliver thrust. Acceleration can be provided with the aid of electric 
   energy and in moments were high amounts of power are required, a bi-directional flow ofof power is used between a battery and eletrical machine. This makes it a promising solution to reduce CO2 
   emissions, as well as lower fuel consumption and reduce total cost.
